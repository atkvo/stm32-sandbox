# STM32 SANDBOX

This project is just intended to become more familiar with the
bare metal STM32 environment including:

    * Build system (Cmake)
    * HAL interface development
    * Device drivers
    * Unit testing embedded firmware.
    * Debugging via OpenOCD/GDB/ST-Link

There is no specific project/application in mind. Just an ongoing learning exercise.
